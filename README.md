# 🛡️ Threat Intelligence Repository
This repository is built for researchers, analysts, and fellow defenders working to curate and contribute to threat intelligence and threat hunting efforts. It’s a **community-driven project** designed to track, detect, and help prevent compromise by threat actors.

In addition to adversary tracking, this project also focuses on:
* Behavioral analysis of malware families seen in the wild
* Infrastructure mapping (C2s, proxies, phishing delivery)
* IOC curation and enrichment
* Context-driven case files and timeline analysis

No raw threat actor logs are hosted, and all indicators have been sanitized and redacted where appropriate.

## ❓ Long Term Plan
* Markdown compatibility with Obsidian Notes. This has already started!
* Completely translate and map Black Basta ransomware group infrastructure based off of Matrix chat logs.
* Create detection opportunities for Black Basta indicators.
